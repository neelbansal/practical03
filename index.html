<p> Constituents of Good Health:
       First, we have our physical health. This means being fit physically and in the absence of any kind of disease or illness. When you have good physical health, you will have a longer life span. One may maintain their physical health by having a balanced diet. Do not miss out on the essential nutrients; take each of them in appropriate quantities.<br>
<br>   Secondly, you must exercise daily. It may be for ten minutes only but never miss it. It will help your body maintain physical fitness. Moreover, do not consume junk food all the time. Do not smoke or drink as it has serious harmful consequences. Lastly, try to take adequate sleep regularly instead of using your phone.<br>
<br>   Next, we talk about our mental health. Mental health refers to the psychological and emotional well-being of a person. The mental health of a person impacts their feelings and way of handling situations. We must maintain our mental health by being positive and meditating.<br>
<br> Subsequently, social health and cognitive health are equally important for the overall well-being of a person. A person can maintain their social health when they effectively communicate well with others. Moreover, when a person us friendly and attends social gatherings, he will definitely have good social health. Similarly, our cognitive health refers to performing mental processes effectively. To do that well, one must always eat healthily and play brain games like Chess, puzzles and more to sharpen the brain.<br>
<br>
Exercise improves self-confidence. One of the reasons many individuals
do not attempt an exercise program is because they feel they are not
very athletic or coordinated. Once an exercise program is begun,
however, these same individuals discover that they are indeed able to
work out successfully: gaining muscle tone and strength, improving
their stamina, and improving how they feel emotionally. These
revelations are very empowering. However, Physical Health Alone is Not Everything.<br>
