<h1>Top three ways to stay Healthy:</h1>
</div>
<h2>1. Eat a variety of foods</h2>
<p>For good health, we need more than 40 different nutrients, and no single food can supply them all. It is not about a single meal, it is about a balanced food choice over time that will make a difference!&nbsp;</p>

&nbsp;<br>
<h2>2. Enjoy plenty of fruits and vegetables</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Fruits and vegetables are among the most important foods for giving us enough vitamins, minerals and fibre. We should try to eat at least 5 servings a day. For example, a glass of fresh fruit juice at breakfast, perhaps an apple and a piece of watermelon as snacks, and a good portion of different vegetables at each meal. &#8220;strength
training&#8221; or &#8220;resistance training.&#8221;<br><br>Strength exercises include lifting weights, even your own body weight, and using a resistance band.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Click On Below Image For Details</span><b></b></p>

    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Help you control your weight. Along with diet, exercise plays an important role in controlling your weight and preventing obesity. To maintain your weight, the calories you eat and drink must equal the energy you burn. To lose weight, you must use more calories than you eat and drink.
            </li>
            <li> Reduce your risk of heart diseases. Exercise strengthens your heart and improves your circulation. The increased blood flow raises the oxygen levels in your body. This helps lower your risk of heart diseases such as high cholesterol, coronary artery disease, and heart attack. Regular exercise can also lower your blood pressure and triglyceride levels.</li>
            <li>Help keep your thinking, learning, and judgment skills sharp as you age. Exercise stimulates your body to release proteins and other chemicals that improve the structure and function of your brain.</li>
        </ul>
